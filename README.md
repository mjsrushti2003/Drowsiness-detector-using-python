The system employs a webcam to monitor real-time facial landmarks, focusing on the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to assess eye 
closure patterns. If drowsiness is detected (based on prolonged eye closure), it triggers both visual and auditory alerts to the 
user. This project aims to reduce accident risks for drivers and heavy machinery operators by providing timely drowsiness 
alerts  # Drowsiness-detector-using-python
